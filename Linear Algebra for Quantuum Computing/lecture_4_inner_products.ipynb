    "The most important vectors we will encounter will be $2$-dimensional complex vector which are of length $1$. In this section we will define the **inner product** of two vectors, and the **norm** (length) of a vector which is derived from the inner product of the vector with itself. The vectors of length $1$ are sometimes referred to as **unit vectors**. We will discuss complex unit vectors in $2$-dimensional space $\\mathbb{C}^2$ and how they relate to qubits. This will lead to a discussion of the **Bloch sphere** which will be a useful way of understanding qubits and how quantum gates act on them. \n",
